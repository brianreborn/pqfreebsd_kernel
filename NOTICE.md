- SPDX: this is **not** a stock SPDX identifier. GitHub may show the

- The lights-on paragraph is an **ethical ask**, not a fifth legal
  condition. Declining it does not affect rights under clauses 1–4.
- No third-party code is vendored here. The modules call into FreeBSD /
  OpenZFS kernel APIs that already ship with the system.

## Integration policy

These modules are **requisite and generic** for PQFreeBSD / MAC work.
Do **not** have other projects vendor or build them on demand yet.
Skills and operators may load the resulting `.ko` files; treat this
tree as a separate kernel deliverable, not a library to pull into
skill trees.
